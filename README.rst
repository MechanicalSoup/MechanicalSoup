Overview
--------

A Python library for automating interaction with websites.
MechanicalSoup automatically stores and sends cookies, follows
redirects, and can follow links and submit forms. It doesn't do
JavaScript.

MechanicalSoup was created by `M Hickford
<https://github.com/hickford/>`__, who was a fond user of the
`Mechanize <https://github.com/jjlee/mechanize>`__ library.
Unfortunately, Mechanize was `incompatible with Python 3 until 2019
<https://github.com/python-mechanize/mechanize/issues/9>`__ and its development
stalled for several years. MechanicalSoup provides a similar API, built on Python
giants `Requests <http://docs.python-requests.org/en/latest/>`__ (for
HTTP sessions) and `BeautifulSoup
<https://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/>`__ (for document
navigation). Since 2017 it is a project actively maintained by a small
team including `@hemberger <https://github.com/hemberger>`__ and `@moy
<https://github.com/moy/>`__.

Documentation
-------------

The full documentation is available on
https://mechanicalsoup.readthedocs.io/. You may want to jump directly to
the `automatically generated API
documentation <https://mechanicalsoup.readthedocs.io/en/stable/mechanicalsoup.html>`__.

Example
-------

From `<examples/expl_qwant.py>`__, code to get the results from
a Qwant search:

.. code:: python

    """Example usage of MechanicalSoup to get the results from the Qwant
    search engine.
    """

    import re
    import mechanicalsoup
    import html
    import urllib.parse

    # Connect to Qwant
    browser = mechanicalsoup.StatefulBrowser(user_agent='MechanicalSoup')
    browser.open("https://lite.qwant.com/")

    # Fill-in the search form
    browser.select_form('#search-form')
    browser["q"] = "MechanicalSoup"
    browser.submit_selected()

    # Display the results
    for link in browser.page.select('.result a'):
        # Qwant shows redirection links, not the actual URL, so extract
        # the actual URL from the redirect link:
        href = link.attrs['href']
        m = re.match(r"^/redirect/[^/]*/(.*)$", href)
        if m:
            href = urllib.parse.unquote(m.group(1))
        print(link.text, '->', href)

More examples are available in `<examples/>`__.

For an example with a more complex form (checkboxes, radio buttons and
textareas), read `<tests/test_browser.py>`__
and `<tests/test_form.py>`__.
