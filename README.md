MechanicalSoup
==============

A Python library for automating interaction with websites. MechanicalSoup automatically stores and sends cookies, follows redirects, and can follow links and submit forms. It doesn't do Javascript.

I was a fond user of the [Mechanize](https://github.com/jjlee/mechanize) library, but unfortunately it's  [incompatible with Python 3](https://github.com/jjlee/mechanize/issues/96) and development is inactive. MechanicalSoup provides a similar API, built on Python giants [Requests](http://docs.python-requests.org/en/latest/) (for http sessions) and [BeautifulSoup](http://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/) (for document navigation).

Installation
------

[![Latest Version](https://img.shields.io/pypi/v/MechanicalSoup.svg)](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/MechanicalSoup/)

From [PyPI](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/MechanicalSoup/)

     pip install MechanicalSoup

Python versions 2.6-2.7, 3.3-3.5, PyPy and PyPy3 are supported (and tested against).

Example
------

From [`example.py`](example.py), code to log into the GitHub website:

```python
"""Example app to login to GitHub"""
import argparse
import mechanicalsoup

parser = argparse.ArgumentParser(description='Login to GitHub.')
parser.add_argument("username")
parser.add_argument("password")
args = parser.parse_args()

browser = mechanicalsoup.Browser()

# request github login page. the result is a requests.Response object http://docs.python-requests.org/en/latest/user/quickstart/#response-content
login_page = browser.get("https://github.com/login")

# login_page.soup is a BeautifulSoup object http://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/bs4/doc/#beautifulsoup
# we grab the login form
login_form = login_page.soup.select("#login")[0].select("form")[0]

# specify username and password
login_form.select("#login_field")[0]['value'] = args.username
login_form.select("#password")[0]['value'] = args.password

# (or alternatively)
# login_form.input({"login": args.username, "password": args.password})

# submit form
page2 = browser.submit(login_form, login_page.url)

# verify we are now logged in
messages = page2.soup.find('div', class_='flash-messages')
if messages:
    print(messages.text)
assert page2.soup.select(".logout-form")

print(page2.soup.title.text)

# verify we remain logged in (thanks to cookies) as we browse the rest of the site
page3 = browser.get("https://github.com/hickford/MechanicalSoup")
assert page3.soup.select(".logout-form")
```

For an example with a more complex form (checkboxes, radio buttons and textareas), read [`tests/test_browser.py`](tests/test_browser.py) and [`tests/test_form.py`](tests/test_form.py).

Common problems
---

### "No parser was explicitly specified"

> UserWarning: No parser was explicitly specified, so I'm using the best available HTML parser for this system ("lxml"). This usually isn't a problem, but if you run this code on another system, or in a different virtual environment, it may use a different parser and behave differently.

Recent versions of BeautifulSoup show a harmless warning to encourage you to specify which HTML parser to use. You can do this in MechanicalSoup:

    mechanicalsoup.Browser(soup_config={'features':'html.parser'})

Or if you have the parser [lxml](http://lxml.de/installation.html) installed:

    mechanicalsoup.Browser(soup_config={'features':'lxml'})

### Roadmap

* Draw [Substack-style](http://substack.net/art) readme art (imagine a steaming bowl of cogs and noodles)
* [Write docs and publish website](https://github.com/hickford/MechanicalSoup/issues/6)
