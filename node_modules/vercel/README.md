## Usage

Vercel is the platform for frontend developers, providing the speed and reliability innovators need to create at the moment of inspiration.

We enable teams to iterate quickly and develop, preview, and ship delightful user experiences. Vercel has zero-configuration support for 35+ frontend frameworks and integrates with your headless content, commerce, or database of choice.

To install the latest version of Vercel CLI, run this command:

```bash
npm i -g vercel
```

To quickly start a new project, run the following commands:

```bash
vercel init     # Pick an example project
cd <PROJECT>    # Change directory to the new project
vercel          # Deploy to the cloud
```

Finally, [connect your Git repository to Vercel](https://vercel.com/docs/git) and deploy with `git push`.

## Documentation

For details on how to use Vercel CLI, check out our [documentation](https://vercel.com/docs/cli).

## Local Development

To develop Vercel CLI, first check out the source code, install dependencies, and build all packages:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/vercel/vercel.git
cd vercel
pnpm install
pnpm build
```

At this point you can make modifications to the CLI source code and test them out locally. The CLI source code is located in the `packages/cli` directory.

```bash
cd packages/cli
```

### `pnpm dev <cli-commands...>`

From within the `packages/cli` directory, you can use the "dev" script to quickly execute Vercel CLI from its TypeScript source code directly (without having to manually compile first). For example:

```bash
pnpm dev deploy
pnpm dev whoami
pnpm dev login
pnpm dev switch --debug
```
