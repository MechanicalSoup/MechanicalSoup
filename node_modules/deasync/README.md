DeAsync.js
=======
[![NPM version](http://img.shields.io/npm/v/deasync.svg)](https://www.npmjs.org/package/deasync)

DeAsync turns async function into sync, implemented with a blocking mechanism by calling Node.js event loop at JavaScript layer. The core of deasync is written in C++.


## Motivation

Suppose you maintain a library that exposes a function <code>getData</code>. Your users call it to get actual data:   
<code>var myData = getData();</code>  
Under the hood data is saved in a file so you implemented <code>getData</code> using Node.js built-in <code>fs.readFileSync</code>. It's obvious both <code>getData</code> and <code>fs.readFileSync</code> are sync functions. One day you were told to switch the underlying data source to a repo such as MongoDB which can only be accessed asynchronously. You were also told for backward compatibility, <code>getData</code> API cannot be changed to return merely a promise or demand a callback parameter. How do you meet both requirements?

You may tempted to use [node-fibers](https://github.com/laverdet/node-fibers) or a module derived from it, but node fibers can only wrap async function call into a sync function inside a fiber. In the case above you cannot assume all  callers are inside fibers. On the other hand, if you start a fiber in `getData` then `getData` itself will still return immediately without waiting for the async call result. For similar reason ES6 generators introduced in Node v0.11 won't work either. 

What really needed is a way to block subsequent JavaScript from running without blocking entire thread by yielding to allow other events in the event loop to be handled. Ideally the blockage is removed as soon as the result of async function is available. A less ideal but often acceptable alternative is a `sleep` function which you can use to implement the blockage like ```while(!done) sleep(100);```. It is less ideal because sleep duration has to be guessed. It is important the `sleep` function not only shouldn't block entire thread, but also shouldn't incur busy wait that pegs the CPU to 100%.

DeAsync supports both alternatives.



## Usages


* Generic wrapper of async function with conventional API signature `function(p1,...pn,function cb(error,result){})`. Returns `result` and throws `error` as exception if not null:

```javascript
var deasync = require('deasync');
var cp = require('child_process');
var exec = deasync(cp.exec);
// output result of ls -la
try{
    console.log(exec('ls -la'));
}
catch(err){
    console.log(err);
}
// done is printed last, as supposed, with cp.exec wrapped in deasync; first without.
console.log('done');
```

* For async function with unconventional API, for instance `function asyncFunction(p1,function cb(res){})`, use `loopWhile(predicateFunc)` where `predicateFunc` is a function that returns boolean loop condition

```javascript
var done = false;
var data;
asyncFunction(p1,function cb(res){
    data = res;
    done = true;
});
require('deasync').loopWhile(function(){return !done;});
// data is now populated
```

* Sleep (a wrapper of setTimeout)

```javascript
function SyncFunction(){
  var ret;
  setTimeout(function(){
      ret = "hello";
  },3000);
  while(ret === undefined) {
    require('deasync').sleep(100);
  }
  // returns hello with sleep; undefined without
  return ret;    
}
```

## Installation
Except on a few [ platforms + Node version combinations](https://github.com/abbr/deasync-bin) where binary distribution is included, DeAsync uses node-gyp to compile C++ source code so you may need the compilers listed in [node-gyp](https://github.com/TooTallNate/node-gyp). You may also need to [update npm's bundled node-gyp](https://github.com/TooTallNate/node-gyp/wiki/Updating-npm's-bundled-node-gyp).

To install, run

```npm install deasync```


## Recommendation
Unlike other (a)sync js packages that mostly have only syntactic impact, DeAsync also changes code execution sequence. As such, it is intended to solve niche cases like the above one. If all you are facing is syntactic problem such as callback hell, using a less drastic package implemented in pure js is recommended.

## Support
Pull requests and issue reporting are welcome. For issues to be considered by maintainer
  1. they must be reproducible
  2. there must be evidence the issue is related to DeAsync

To that end, the issue should contain platform information, error message relevant to DeAsync, and preferably code snippet. If code snippet is supplied, it must be self-contained, i.e. independent from your runtime environment or other modules not explicitly specified via `require` in the code snippet.
