   You can adapt this file completely to your liking, but it should at least
   contain the root `toctree` directive.

Welcome to MechanicalSoup's documentation!
==========================================

A Python library for automating interaction with websites. MechanicalSoup automatically stores and sends cookies, follows redirects, and can follow links and submit forms. It doesn't do Javascript.

I was a fond user of the Mechanize library, but unfortunately it's incompatible with Python 3 and development is inactive. MechanicalSoup provides a similar API, built on Python giants Requests (for http sessions) and BeautifulSoup (for document navigation).
